This is a repository where I practice a most sacred hobby -- making minimal
and repeatable builds of TeX variants. I hope it will be of use for the two or three
people around the globe who, for reasons I cannot imagine, decide to build TeX
from scratch.

The only completed build now is in the `patched-tex-fpc` directory.
